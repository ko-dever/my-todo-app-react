React Test ToDo App:
  ☐ Try to make a composition for list items (different types active/completed/archived)
    An "active item" is almost the same as a "completed item" and "archived item", except for their style.
    See : https://reactjs.org/docs/composition-vs-inheritance.html
  ☐ Implements dynamic import when possible
  ☐ Try to include remote data fetching using https://www.mockapi.io/docs for example
  ☐ Sort archived items by the date when they were archived
  ☐ Organize items into different Arrays (in state?), with a key (the filter?) pointing to displayed items ?
    state = {
      filter: 'archived',
      todos : { archived: [ ...], completed: [...], active: [...] }
    }
  ☐ Add routes (react-router) to mimic the filters
    The URL should reflect the list currently displayed http://.../actives, http://.../completed, ...
  ☐ Improve comments and documentation of functions (JSDoc /** */)
    https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/JsDoc-support-in-JavaScript
  ☐ Improve the integration of TypeScript (at least for the code checking)
  ☐ Try to implement somewhere a HOC
    Without adding too much complexity to the code
  ☐ Implement tests (Jest?)
